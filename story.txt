how to lure her to somewhere quiet to abduct her, the nice baker who always provide the tasty fresh bread for her family is wondering whether her body would fit 
in his stove, and the gardener who always hide in the shade of the bushes is considering bury her alive under his favorite Hydrangea... Snow White then found out
that most of the people is lured by the Queen to overthrow the nation. "What should I do?", She kept asking herself.

everything, only find the King lying on that cold throne with the Queen on the side. She then found the Queen's mind full of fulfillment and happiness, and that is 
the only thought she read in the hall. "Why couldn't I read my father's mind? Why would there only be her thoughts?", Snow White is almost desperate...
